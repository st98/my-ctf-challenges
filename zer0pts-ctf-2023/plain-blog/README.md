# [Web] Plain Blog
## Description
I made a blog service consists of two servers: API server and Frontend server. The former provides APIs that you can see, add, or modify posts. The latter uses responses from API server and render it.
If you could get 1,000,000,000,000 likes on your post, I will give you the flag. The maximum number of likes is 5,000, though.

API server: (URL)
Frontend server: (URL)
